- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Wagner! I am a brazilian aspiring developer. I'm focusing on front end development right now, but I do want to get to know the back end in due time.

- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript. My roadmap consists in diving deep on JS and React, mastering both. I do want to get proficient in Typescript also! I wish 
      to learn JS for the back end as well, going through Node.JS. For the visual aspects of web development, I'll be learning Bootstrap, but I really want to get to 
      Tailwind. As a bonus, I'll be learning some basic concepts of UI & UX design (not going deep into it, though).

- ðŸ¥‡ On the side, my interests go deep in the physical activities world! Exercising really makes my heart pump! It's meditation to me... my happy place. 
      I practice Jiu Jitsu, aim to get the black belt in the art. I also want to complete a full IRONMAN in the near future, so I love running, cycling and swimming
      (which I need to get to!). I also really like strenght training! To do all the rest, it is critical and it also helps me feel pretty good!

- ðŸŽ¯ Right now Iâ€™m looking for my first position, be it an internship, assistance, or junior on a team that is willing to bet on me as much as I am willing to give my 
      all! I would also like to colaborate on open projects but I'm still pretty new to this...

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my e-mail: wagutoxd@gmail.com or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wagner-zoccoli-front-end-web-developer/) profile.

Cheers!
